Get started:

- clone this repo

- ⚠️ DONT: fork this repo as this shows other applicants your solution

- ✅ DO: clone repo, create new repo on Github and make this the remote with git remote set-url origin

- run `npm i` to install all dependencies

- run `npm run test` (1 test should succeed and 3 should fail)

- create a new repo on github

- create a **new** github repo with public access

- push your code to this repo (change origin url)



Hints:

- you can not push to the repo you cloned as it is not yours

- you can change the origin url to your repo with `git remote set-url <remote_name> <remote_url>` and push to your new repo
